# Secured Doorly

## Overview
Secured Doorly is a smart lock system for homes that removes the need of using physical key and lock system or RFID cards to gain entry. Although keys and RFID cards have been effective and convenient methodologies for users to gain access to their homes, we want to take this to the next level. Secured doorly will provide authorised users a way to unlock their home door remotely from a mobile app securely. This will remove the need for users to carry around a key or card with them which may be misplaced or stolen allowing unauthorised users to gain entry to their homes. Thus, users can unlock their home door from a secured app allowing authorised users such as themselves, family and friends to gain entry to their home.
